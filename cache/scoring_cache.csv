10.1186_s12889-025-21995-y.pdf,bold_rigorous_research_approaches_rubric,R1,1,"The research study is rigorous in its approach, using a retrospective analysis of data from the California State Inpatient Database (SID) to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart failure hospitalizations. The study design is well-defined, with clear primary and secondary outcomes, and the use of statistical analysis to understand the differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. However, the study does not seem to be particularly ambitious or high-risk, nor does it aim to achieve a paradigm shift or major advances in the field. It is more of a standard epidemiological study, which, while important, does not meet the criteria for a score of 2 in this rubric."
10.1186_s12889-025-21995-y.pdf,bold_rigorous_research_approaches_rubric,R2,2,"The research publication demonstrates a rigorous approach to research. The methods section outlines a clear and detailed study design, including the data source, study population, study variables and outcomes, and statistical analysis. The researchers used a retrospective analysis of data from the California State Inpatient Database (SID), followed the STROBE guideline for ensuring the quality of the study, and used ICD-10-CM diagnosis and procedure codes for identifying hospitalizations and procedures. They also used descriptive statistics, Rao-Scott chi-square test, t test and Mann-Whitney U test, and propensity score matching (PSM) for their analysis. The results section provides a comprehensive presentation of the findings, including comparisons of demographic and clinical risk profiles, monthly trends of heart failure hospitalization rates, and adverse hospital outcomes. The researchers also conducted regression analysis to find differences in strength of association between hospitalization during 2019 and 2020 with regards to outcome variables. All these elements indicate a robust and rigorous research approach."
10.1186_s12889-025-21995-y.pdf,bold_rigorous_research_approaches_rubric,R3,1,"The research publication demonstrates some aspects of the 'R3' subcategory of the 'bold_rigorous_research_approaches_rubric'. The study is rigorous in its approach, using a large sample size and comparing data from different years to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on heart failure hospitalizations. However, there is no mention of high-reward research, reproducibility, or sharing data. The study does not seem to take any significant risks or propose any groundbreaking hypotheses that could lead to high rewards.
